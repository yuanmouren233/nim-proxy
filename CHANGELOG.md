# Changelog

All notable changes to nim-proxy are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.5] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Persisted dashboard traffic now appears immediately after login and remains
  truthful across process/container restarts. Startup indexing normalizes
  explicit v2 process epochs and legacy v1 counter resets; chart point limits
  no longer change reported totals.
- The existing dashboard time controls now apply one selected window across
  Overview, Models, Clients, Reliability, and Capacity. The default follows
  the retained 30-day window, fixed/paused ranges stay fixed, and **All
  retained** reaches the earliest available sample.
- Historical Capacity views now use the configuration recorded with each
  sample instead of comparing past traffic with today's pool. Unavailable
  pre-history time is no longer treated as observed capacity.

### Security

- Moved release metadata and image digests from inline shell-template
  expansions into step-scoped environment variables, and added a seven-day
  observation window for routine Cargo, GitHub Actions, and Docker dependency
  updates. Dependabot security updates remain immediate.
- Replaced the third-party GitHub Release publishing action with the
  GitHub-hosted runner's preinstalled `gh` CLI, preserving generated notes,
  verification instructions, and signed asset uploads while reducing the
  workflow's external action surface.

### Changed

- Docker Compose's host-side publish address is now configurable with
  `PUBLISH_HOST` in `.env` while retaining `127.0.0.1` as the safe default.
- Replaced browser parsing of raw `/metrics`, `/api/history`, and
  `/dash/config.json` data with authenticated typed range/current dashboard
  contracts, revision-aware live tails, and server-side exact rollups.
- Default dashboard window, data retention, and availability target are
  separate Server settings rather than hardcoded display assumptions. Window
  and retention default to 30 days; retention `0` is unlimited and finite
  retention cannot be shorter than the default view.
- Current lane/load values use the live **Now** snapshot while selected-window
  values stay historical.
- History retention now trims the in-memory index immediately and compacts the
  JSONL file atomically in the background while preserving the boundary
  baseline and boot marker needed for exact retained totals. The old
  fixed-size estimate was removed after a real 7,316-sample history measured
  235,598,655 bytes; size remains workload-dependent.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Added the opt-in `X-Nim-Proxy-Deadline-Ms` request header: an absolute
  wall-clock deadline enforced across queueing, worker admission, retries, and
  generation. Buffered expiry returns `504 deadline_exceeded`; streaming
  expiry emits the same error inside the committed SSE response. Expiry drops
  upstream work and all request-owned permits, and is exposed as request status
  `deadline` plus `nimproxy_deadline_exceeded_total`.

### Security

- Bumped `crossbeam-epoch` to 0.9.20 in `Cargo.lock` to resolve
  [RUSTSEC-2026-0204](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0204)
  (invalid pointer dereference in the `fmt::Pointer` impl for `Atomic`/`Shared`).
  It reaches us transitively via `metrics-util` →
  `metrics-exporter-prometheus`. Lockfile-only change; no dependency versions
  in `Cargo.toml` changed. Clears the `cargo-deny` advisories failure that was
  red on `main` and every open Dependabot PR.

### Changed

- Refreshed runtime and supply-chain dependencies: Tokio 1.53.1, bytes 1.12.1,
  serde 1.0.229, serde_json 1.0.151, futures-util 0.3.33, tokio-stream 0.1.19,
  the pinned Rust builder image and toolchain action, pinned GitHub Actions,
  and `sigstore/cosign-installer` 4.1.2.
- Migrated downloadable-asset signing to Cosign v3 Sigstore bundles, pinned
  the Cosign CLI independently of its installer action, and added a real
  sign/verify contract smoke test to CI.
- Internal cleanup (no behavior change): dropped a redundant `async` on the
  streaming handler (all `.await`s live inside its spawned task, so the
  function itself never awaited — this avoids wrapping it in a needless
  future), removed two redundant `String` clones on the key-add paths, and
  reused the destination buffer via `clone_from` when re-owning keys during
  superuser claim. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt`,
  and the full test suite (lib + e2e) stay green.
- Rewrote the `Basic`-auth credential branch in `auth::identify` with the `?`
  operator (behavior identical). Rust stable rolled to 1.97 on 2026-07-14 and
  its improved `clippy::question_mark` lint flagged the old
  `else if let … else { return None }` shape, breaking the `-D warnings` CI
  job on code untouched by any open PR. Covered by the existing auth tests.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-05

Supply-chain and static-analysis release — no proxy behavior changes.

### Documentation

- Enriched the PR template into a standard, agent-legible form (Summary / Type
  of change / Related issues / What & why / How it was tested / Breaking
  changes, plus a checklist grouped by concern with each conditional section
  labeled by its trigger).
- Documentation-consistency pass across README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, the
  test-strategy and release runbooks, and the issue templates: recorded the
  full current CI gate set (coverage, MSRV, workflow lint, dependency review,
  CodeQL) and the applied `main`/`v*` rulesets, added the fuzzing test layer
  and signed-release-asset notes, and corrected a stale `cargo audit` reference
  (it is `cargo-deny`) and an old version placeholder.

### Testing

- **Coverage expansion** (91.4% → 96.1% lines): new unit tests for the auth
  primitives (base64/unhex/session-shape/cookie-Secure/throttle-rollover —
  `auth.rs` is now 100%), `config::validate` rejection branches, `parse_role`
  (superuser is never assignable), the SSE 1 MiB guard, and history load +
  daily-compaction; plus e2e tests for setup double-claim, orphan client-key
  adoption, throttled/failed key probes, client/nim-key/user validation and
  ownership legs, and the auth handler surface (HTTP Basic scrape creds, login
  redirects, logout). The CI coverage gate is raised from 80% to 90%.

### Added

- **Release assets are signed** (`cosign sign-blob`, keyless via OIDC): the
  downloadable per-arch tarballs and the SBOM now ship with a detached
  signature (`.sig`) and the signing certificate (`.pem`), so a binary pulled
  from the Releases page is verifiable with `cosign verify-blob` — previously
  only the container image was signed. The release notes carry the exact
  verification command.

- **Fuzz testing** (`fuzz/` + a weekly smoke-fuzz workflow): cargo-fuzz
  targets for the three untrusted-byte parsers — the upstream SSE scanner
  (arbitrary fragmentation, buffer-bound invariant), the Prometheus-label
  sanitizer (charset/length/non-empty invariants), and the config-store
  JSON round-trip (parse never panics; save→load is a fixpoint). The crate
  is now a thin binary over a library so the fuzz harnesses can link the
  internals; no public API is added (`#[doc(hidden)]` wrappers only).

- **Repo hygiene & metadata**: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` (LF
  normalization + language-stats fix so the repo reads as Rust, not HTML),
  `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable + rustfmt/clippy for contributors),
  `SUPPORT.md`, and a release-notes template (`.github/release.yml`) that
  groups generated notes by PR label. Cargo.toml now declares
  `rust-version = "1.87"` (measured with `cargo msrv find`) plus
  keywords/categories/homepage, and a new CI `msrv` job builds with exactly
  that toolchain. The Docker build base is digest-pinned. README gains the
  OpenSSF Best Practices badge and a contributing/security/support section.

- **CodeQL static analysis** for the Rust source on every PR, push to main,
  and a weekly re-scan (`build-mode: none` — no cargo build needed).
- **Workflow lint job in CI**: `actionlint` (correctness, always gates) and
  `zizmor` (Actions security lint; every severity is uploaded to code
  scanning, high-severity findings fail the build).
- **Dependency review on PRs**: introducing a crate with a known
  vulnerability now fails the PR (licenses stay `cargo-deny`'s job).
- **Weekly advisories audit** (`audit.yml`): the lockfile is checked against
  the RUSTSEC database on a schedule, so a new advisory surfaces within a
  week instead of at the next push.

### Changed

- Upgraded the CodeQL Action from v3 to v4 (both `codeql.yml` and the
  Scorecard SARIF upload), clearing the Node 20 deprecation and the
  December-2026 v3 sunset warnings.

- **CodeQL scope**: a config file (`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`) now
  excludes the `tests/**` and `fuzz/**` trees, so the hard-coded-secret
  queries fire on the operator-facing source but not on intentional test
  fixtures (throwaway passwords, RFC-vector salts). The handful of fixture
  alerts inside `#[cfg(test)]` modules in scanned source are dismissed as
  "used in tests".

- The release workflow now runs under a global concurrency group (one release
  at a time, queued rather than cancelled), and the `prepare` script takes
  workflow-context values via `env` instead of inline template expansion.

- **Workflow hardening to the OpenSSF-recommended baseline**: every GitHub
  Actions step is pinned to a full commit SHA (Dependabot keeps the pins
  fresh); all CI/release jobs start with `step-security/harden-runner` egress
  monitoring (audit mode); checkouts that don't push drop their credentials
  (`persist-credentials: false`); and a weekly OpenSSF Scorecard workflow
  publishes the repo's supply-chain score to code scanning and the README
  badge.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-04

CI/release infrastructure release — no proxy behavior changes.

### Changed

- **Release images build on native runners in parallel**: amd64 on
  `ubuntu-latest` and arm64 on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, each pushed by digest and
  stitched into one multi-arch manifest; the cosign signature, provenance
  attestation, and SBOM now target the manifest digest. This removes the
  QEMU-emulated arm64 Rust compile that made releases take ~30 minutes.
  Buildx layer caching added to the release and CI image builds.
- CI runs superseded by a newer push to the same ref are cancelled
  (concurrency groups; main is never cancelled), and the CI image smoke test
  no longer sets legacy env vars retired in 0.6.0.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-04

Maintenance release — no proxy behavior changes; it exists to ship and
validate the new release automation.

### Changed

- **Releases can be cut from the Actions UI** (`workflow_dispatch` on the
  Release workflow): a new `prepare` job resolves the version from Cargo.toml
  on the default branch, refuses if that tag already exists, mints and pushes
  the `v*` tag itself, and the same run carries the release end-to-end — no
  local `git tag`/`git push` needed. The tag-push path still works and keeps
  its tag-must-match-Cargo.toml guard; image tags and the GitHub Release tag
  now come from the resolved version rather than the triggering git ref.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-04

> **Breaking (v0.6.0):** app-level configuration moved from env vars into a
> UI-managed store. `NIM_API_KEYS`, `PROXY_API_KEYS`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
> `INSECURE_NO_AUTH`, `NIM_BASE_URL`, `RPM_PER_KEY`, `MAX_WAIT_SECS`,
> `HEARTBEAT_SECS`, `MODELS_TTL_SECS`, `STREAM_IDLE_SECS`,
> `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `STRICT_PASSTHROUGH`, `REF_PRICE_IN`/`REF_PRICE_OUT`,
> `HISTORY_DAYS`, and `MAX_INFLIGHT` are **ignored** (a one-line boot warning
> lists any still set). Configure everything in the dashboard on first run. The
> dashboard is now multi-user (username + password), and `INSECURE_NO_AUTH` is
> replaced by an `open|keyed` API-access mode that affects only `/v1`. There is
> no migration (there were no deployments to migrate).

### Added

- **UI-managed config store + first-run setup wizard**: app-level config lives
  in `DATA_DIR/config.json` (version 1, atomic writes, 0600), edited from a new
  dashboard **Settings** area (sub-nav: Access & keys · Server · Users ·
  Account) and claimed by a 3-step wizard (create superuser → add ≥1 NIM key,
  validated live against the upstream → finish, logged in). A corrupt/unreadable
  or future-version store is a hard boot error, never a silent fall-through to
  setup. JSON not SQLite — see
  `knowledge/decisions/ui-managed-config-store.md`.
- **Multi-user with roles & per-key ownership**: `superuser` (an admin that can
  never be deleted), `admin` (server settings + user management), `user` (own
  account, own client keys, own NIM keys). Dashboards are identical for every
  role; `GET /api/config` is filtered server-side so hidden sections are absent
  from the payload, not CSS-hidden. Sessions carry the username plus a fragment
  of the password hash, so a password change/reset invalidates that user's
  sessions instantly and role changes/deletion apply on the next request.
  Passwords are PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600k iterations, RFC 7914 vectors). See the
  v0.6.0 amendment in
  `knowledge/decisions/auth-posture-and-dashboard-password.md`.
- **Per-key rpm and live key management**: each NIM key has its own rpm
  (default 40, range 1–10000), an owner, and an enable/disable toggle; the pool
  rebuilds live on any change with rate-state carryover (kept keys keep their
  in-window counts; disabled keys re-enable warm). The superuser always owns ≥1
  enabled key (the pool floor). Client API keys are server-generated 128-bit
  secrets with an `npk_` prefix, shown exactly once and stored only as SHA-256
  digests (+ last-4 for display).
- **Model-pressure governor**: classifies NIM's per-model worker-concurrency
  exhaustion (`Worker local total request limit reached`) apart from plain 429s
  and backs off the **model** (never benches the lane, since key failover can't
  help). Adaptive and zero-config (engages at half observed in-flight, +1 per
  stable minute, dissolves after 30 clean minutes) with optional per-model
  pinned caps in Settings. New metrics `nimproxy_worker_exhausted_total{model}`,
  `nimproxy_model_inflight{model}`, `nimproxy_model_limit{model}` (0 =
  ungoverned), and a Reliability **Model pressure** card that appears only once
  the governor has engaged. See `knowledge/architecture/governor.md`;
  `mock_nim.py` gained `--worker-slots N` and `loadtest.py` reports worker
  exhaustions + peak per-model concurrency.
- **Redesigned dashboard**: a dark, NVIDIA-green "operator console" — left
  sidebar nav (collapses to an icon rail below 860px), top bar with range
  pills, Space Grotesk + Spline Sans Mono webfonts. Five persona-aligned tabs
  (`Overview · Models · Clients · Reliability · Capacity`), richer KPI cards
  with trend delta chips and sparklines, ring gauges, and a Reliability hero
  (availability vs a 99.9% SLO, a "where time goes" latency breakdown) and a
  Capacity hero (saturation bar, keys-for-peak provisioning chip). Every line
  chart now has a hover crosshair with a per-series tooltip, and every table
  is click-to-sort with a sticky header and internal scroll — sort order and
  scroll position both survive the 3s live refresh. See
  `knowledge/decisions/dashboard-operator-console-redesign.md`.
- **The wizard mints your first client key**: setup ends on a connect panel
  with the client base URL and a once-only `npk_` secret, so a fresh
  keyed-mode proxy serves `/v1` with no Settings detour. On by default;
  opting out shows an explicit warning (keyed with zero keys rejects every
  `/v1` call until a key exists).
- **New dashboard charts** for signals that were collected but never drawn:
  requests-by-outcome over time (Reliability), requested output budget per
  harness from `nimproxy_request_max_tokens` (Clients), and tool-call volume
  per model from `nimproxy_tool_calls_total` (Models).

### Fixed

- **Streaming requests now count against `max_inflight` for their whole
  lifetime.** The in-flight guard previously dropped when the response headers
  were returned, so the cap only bounded buffered requests — a flood of live
  streams could exceed it unbounded.
- **A client disconnect during a blocked upstream read is noticed
  immediately.** The streaming relay now races each upstream read against the
  client channel closing, so a hang-up frees the request's `max_inflight`
  slot at disconnect time instead of at the `stream_idle` cutoff — and a hung
  upstream can no longer pin a slot until restart when `stream_idle` is 0.
- **Own-password change guards against a concurrent admin reset.** The change
  commits only if the stored hash is still the one the current password was
  verified against; a reset landing in the verify window now wins with a 409
  instead of being silently overwritten by the stale change.

### Changed

- **Env shrinks to 5 container-level vars** (`HOST`, `PORT`, `DATA_DIR`,
  `RUST_LOG`, `TRUST_PROXY`); `DATA_DIR` must be writable (it now holds the
  credential store as well as history) and an unwritable dir is a hard boot
  error. `.env.example`, README, and the runbooks are rewritten to match; the
  quickstart is now `docker compose up` → open the dashboard → complete the
  wizard.
- **Dashboard auth is now user-based.** Login takes a username and password;
  the single `ADMIN_PASSWORD` gate is gone. Prometheus scrapers authenticate as
  `Authorization: Bearer <username>:<password>` (or HTTP Basic). Volume backups
  now contain credentials (`config.json`, 0600) — treat them as secrets.
- `docker compose up` now runs the published `ghcr.io/miztertea/nim-proxy:latest`
  image instead of building from source; source builds move to an explicit dev
  override (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, tagged `nim-proxy:dev`). README,
  CONTRIBUTING, and the deploy runbook updated to match.
- **CSP** now allows the dashboard's webfonts: `style-src` gained
  `https://fonts.googleapis.com`, and a new `font-src` allows
  `https://fonts.gstatic.com`. Falls back to system fonts if the CDN is
  unreachable.

### Removed

- **All app-level env vars** (see the breaking note above) — they're ignored,
  with a one-line boot warning listing any still set. No seed-from-env, no
  migration.
- **`INSECURE_NO_AUTH`.** Replaced by the store's `open|keyed` API-access mode,
  which governs only `/v1`; every dashboard/observability surface always
  requires a logged-in session post-setup.
- **Light mode.** The dashboard is dark-only now; the light palette and
  `prefers-color-scheme` handling were deleted as a committed design choice.
- **The Compare tab** — its head-to-head scorecard and generation-speed bar
  race are now a section of the Models tab.
- **The heatmap's table-view toggle** — not part of the redesign; the heatmap
  keeps its per-cell hover tooltips.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-03

First public release: the repository is now public, and this tag publishes the
first signed multi-arch container image to GHCR with SBOM and build provenance.

### Fixed

- **Unauthenticated panic in the login handler.** A percent-escape followed by a
  multibyte UTF-8 character (e.g. `password=%€`) in the `POST /login` body sliced a
  `&str` on a non-char boundary and panicked. Percent-decoding is now byte-safe.
- **No timeout on non-streaming upstream reads.** A buffered request whose upstream
  sent headers then stalled the body could hang forever, pinning an in-flight slot.
  Non-streaming requests now honor `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 300s) and surface a
  `502` on a stalled/failed body read. Streaming still uses `STREAM_IDLE_SECS`.
- **`RPM_PER_KEY=0` wedged the dispatcher** (out-of-bounds index in the pacer). Now
  rejected at startup.
- Login throttle window uses saturating subtraction (robust to clock adjustments).

### Added

- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` config (default 300).

### Changed

- Regression tests for all of the above; coverage raised to ~90%.

### Performance

- Build with `opt-level = 3` (was `"z"`): the release profile optimized for size,
  throttling the JSON-parse and SSE-scan hot paths. Binary grows ~3.5→4.6 MB.
- Drop a deep clone of the whole request body on the streaming injection path
  (move it instead); use `Bytes::from_static` for the SSE control frames.
- Routine `cargo update` (`rustc-hash` patch).

### Dependencies

- Bump `metrics-exporter-prometheus` 0.17 → 0.18 and refresh CI/release action
  versions, including the Node 24 runtime wave (gitleaks-action v3, the docker/*
  build actions, download-artifact v8).
- Hold the auth crypto/RNG stack (`hmac` 0.12, `sha2` 0.10, `getrandom` 0.2) on
  the proven-stable line — the proposed 0.13/0.11/0.3 majors are breaking with no
  security fix; Dependabot is configured to only take patches for these.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-02

The proxy becomes a **benchmarking and agent-observability tool**: because it
sits in the request path for every harness and model, it can now report *how*
each agent behaves and *how well* each model responds — all from counts and
sizes, never message content.

### Added

- **Request-shape & response-quality metrics**, captured from the request path
  that was already deserialized and scanned: conversation depth, tools offered,
  sampling temperature, `max_tokens`, stream-vs-buffered and JSON-mode mix
  (labeled by client/harness), plus finish-reason/truncation, tool calls,
  reasoning ("thinking") tokens, and mean TPOT (labeled by model). Everything is
  bounded-cardinality with server-clamped enums — counts and sizes only, never
  content. See `knowledge/decisions/request-shape-metrics.md`.
- **Six persona-aligned dashboard views** (Overview, Models, Compare, Harnesses,
  Proxy, Keys), rebuilt from the previous three tabs, each ordered
  at-a-glance → trends → detail, in light and dark mode. Adds a head-to-head
  model scorecard, per-harness fingerprints, and a hash-to-hue color fallback
  past the six categorical slots.
- Generation-speed (tok/s) median/p95 trend, a ranked non-success-outcome
  breakdown, and threshold-colored capacity/success-rate gauges.
- Example [`examples/opencode.json`](examples/opencode.json) config tuned for
  GLM-5.2 (context, compaction, sampling), with rationale in
  `examples/README.md`.

### Changed

- Test coverage extended to the buffered `relay()` quality path, an
  unknown-`finish_reason` → `other` clamp, JSON mode, and non-`auto`
  `tool_choice` — now **29 unit + 21 e2e** tests.
- Load harness gained tool/JSON/sampling variety and a corrected boot command
  (`INSECURE_NO_AUTH`); re-run clean at 240 requests, 0 failures, 0 upstream
  rate violations, balanced across all keys.

### Security

- Pre-merge hardening pass: a dedicated dashboard-XSS audit plus a full security
  review of the branch found **zero** vulnerabilities — every new `innerHTML`
  value is escaped, every new label is a bounded enum/histogram, and no route
  left the admin gate.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-02

Security-hardening release. A review of the merged proxy found a stored-XSS
chain, unbounded metric-label cardinality, log injection, and an open-by-default
posture. All fixed.

### Added

- **Fail-closed auth.** The proxy refuses to start on a network-reachable port
  without auth. Secure mode requires `PROXY_API_KEYS` (gates `/v1/*`, any key
  works, constant-time compare) and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (gates the dashboard,
  `/metrics`, and `/api/history` via an HMAC-signed, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict
  session cookie; Bearer/Basic for scrapers). Open mode is an explicit
  `INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true` opt-in. See
  `knowledge/decisions/auth-posture-and-dashboard-password.md`.
- Failed-login throttle, a rejected-API-key delay, and a `MAX_INFLIGHT`
  flood-shedding cap.
- `cargo audit` in CI.

### Security

- **Input sanitizing.** Client-controlled `model`/`path` labels are sanitized to
  a conservative charset, length-capped, and cardinality-bounded at ingest —
  killing the exposition/log-injection and cardinality-blowup vectors. The
  dashboard `esc()`-escapes every dynamic `innerHTML` sink, and all responses
  carry a strict `Content-Security-Policy` plus anti-framing/anti-sniffing
  headers. See `knowledge/decisions/input-sanitizing-and-xss.md`.
- Compose now publishes `127.0.0.1:8000:8000` (loopback) by default, so a bare
  `docker compose up` can't accidentally expose an open instance.
- Verified with a real-browser XSS check (payload rendered inert), a secure-mode
  load test (300/300, 0 rate violations), and a clean `cargo audit`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

Observability and hardening enrichments on top of the core proxy.

### Added

- **Prometheus `/metrics`** exposition and optional client access keys
  (`PROXY_API_KEYS`) for per-client attribution.
- **Built-in dashboard** — a single embedded HTML file (no Grafana, no config) —
  plus an ASCII boot banner, structured startup detail, one-line-per-request
  access logs (TTY-detected ANSI color), and a self-probe healthcheck
  (`nim-proxy --health`) that works `FROM scratch`.
- **Metrics history**: a ~4 KB snapshot every 5 minutes, retained `HISTORY_DAYS`
  days, powering time-range reports (1h/6h/24h/7d/30d + custom) that survive
  restart.
- Model cards with id-namespace enrichment (the `/v1/models` schema research
  killed the idea of API-sourced descriptions).

### Changed

- Proxy hardened and given a full test suite (unit + e2e against a scripted mock
  NIM) and a load harness (`scripts/mock_nim.py --enforce` + `scripts/loadtest.py`).
- The `knowledge/` Open Knowledge Format bundle was compiled: design decisions,
  validated NIM research, architecture notes, and runbooks.

### Fixed

- Docker build on the musl-host Alpine builder: pass an explicit `--target` so
  global `crt-static` RUSTFLAGS skip proc-macro dylibs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

Initial rate-limit-aware proxy.

### Added

- OpenAI-compatible pass-through to NVIDIA NIM with **per-key sliding-window
  rate limiting** (40 requests per rolling 60 s, matching NIM's limiter) and
  multi-key load balancing.
- **Global FIFO dispatcher** — one queue for all clients, slots granted strictly
  in arrival order, abandoned-waiter slots returned — for fair multi-client
  allocation.
- **Conversation affinity with least-loaded spillover**: each conversation pins
  to one key to keep the server-side prefix cache warm, spilling to the
  least-loaded ready lane when its lane is full.
- **Distroless image**: a static musl binary shipped `FROM scratch` (~3.5 MB,
  TLS roots compiled in), running non-root with hardened compose defaults.
